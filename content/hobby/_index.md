## Woodworking
I first pursued this hobby as part of a project my senior year where I had to devote 100 hours to learning a new skill. I've made some small nicknacks since then but I've been meaning to pursue some bigger projects when I get some more free time ðŸ˜….

The only woodworking I had done up until starting my independent project was making small bird houses as a kid with wood glue and a hack saw. So, I figured out quickly that I had to buy more tools and study a lot to make some more interesting things! 

The projects I made weren't the most polished but I'm proud of what I made. In the PDF below is a detailed log of my progress throughout the year.
