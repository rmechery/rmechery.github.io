# About

I'm currently a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst studying Computer Science. I have a passion for fullstack development, cloud computing platforms, and 3D design. But I'm still exploring new technologies and trying new things! Outside of school, I like to listen to music, play pool, and occasionally woodwork. Check out my hobbies [here](/hobby).
