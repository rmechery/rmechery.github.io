## About

Graphity was a hackathon project built with my friends, [Aaron Tian](https://atian.me), [Henry Liu](https://henryliu714.github.io/), and Vinayak Rao, for [HackUMass XI](https://hackumass.com/). 

It is a teaching tool used to visualize a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) and test traversal algorithms like [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) or [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) on it.

This project ended up winning an award sponsored by [MLH](https://mlh.io/) for **Best .Tech Domain Name** which means that we won our domain for life.
