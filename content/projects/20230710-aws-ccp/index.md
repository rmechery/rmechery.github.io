## About
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam covers basic cloud computing topics and all services provided by AWS. As I studied for this exam, I wrote markdown notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and used [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to convert them into a github pages website. 

With the custom domain I added, some features seem to be broken but the site essentially acts as an online obsidian notebook.

Visit the site [here](https://github.com/rmechery/AWS_Cloud_Practitioner_Notes).
